# React Frontend for User Management Application

This is the frontend for the **User Management Application**, built using **React**. The frontend interacts with the **Node.js backend** to perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on user data.

## Technologies Used

- **React** - JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Axios** - Promise-based HTTP client for making API requests.
- **Bootstrap** - Frontend framework for responsive design and styling.
- **CORS** - Cross-Origin Resource Sharing for frontend-backend communication.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Ensure that you have **Node.js** and **npm** installed. You can check your installations by running:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/user-management-app.git
   cd user-management-app
   ```

2. Navigate to the `frontend` directory:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

---

## Setup

1. **Frontend and Backend Interaction**: The frontend is set up to interact with the Node.js backend at `http://localhost:5000`. Make sure the backend server is running before starting the frontend.

2. **User Interface**: The app displays a list of users with buttons to:
   - Add new users
   - Edit existing users
   - Delete users

3. **API Calls**: Axios is used for making HTTP requests to the backend endpoints. The application communicates with the following API endpoints in the backend:

   - `GET /users` - Fetches all users
   - `POST /users` - Adds a new user
   - `PUT /users/:id` - Updates a user
   - `DELETE /users/:id` - Deletes a user

---

## Running the Application

1. Start the frontend development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

2. The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

3. The frontend will interact with the backend at `http://localhost:5000` to perform CRUD operations on users.

---

## Troubleshooting

1. **CORS Issues**: If you encounter CORS errors, ensure that your backend is running and has CORS properly configured. The backend should have middleware to allow cross-origin requests.

2. **API Errors**: Check the browser console for any errors related to API requests. If the backend isn't responding, verify that it is running on the correct port (`http://localhost:5000`).

3. **Styling Issues**: If the styling is not being applied, ensure that Bootstrap CSS is correctly imported in `src/index.js`:
   ```javascript
   import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css';
   ```

4. **User List Not Showing**: If the user list is not appearing, check that the backend is correctly providing the `/users` data. Ensure that the frontend is making the correct GET request and receiving a valid response.
